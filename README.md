# VBA-challenge
This is my Module 2 Challenge.
quateronescript.png is the screenshot of the output generated by the script quateronescript.bas file which shows ticker symbol with quaterly change, percentage change and total stock volume in one quater.
functionalscript.png is the screenshot of the output generated by the functionalscript.bas file which shows additional information about the ticker with greatest percentage increase and decrease along with greatet total volume in that particular quater.
everyquaterscript.bas file has the approtpriate adjustments to my previous script that enables us to run the script on every worksheet at once.
some of the symobols used in my code refers to the following
op = opening price, cp = closing price, stri = ticker with greatest % increase, strd = ticker with greatest % decrease, strd = ticker with greated stock volume
"for loop" goes all the way from the second row to end row
"do while loop" run unless a new ticker is detected
maxa, mina and tt are used as a temporary variable to store the greates increse, decrease and greatest total stock volume.
